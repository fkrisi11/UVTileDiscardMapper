# UV Tile Discard Mapper
A program that helps you create maps that help you remember which UV tile has which mesh on it.<br>
This is intended to be used with the [Poiyomi Toon Unity shader](https://github.com/poiyomi/PoiyomiToonShader), which is why the layout shows 4x4 UV tiles, which is exactly what the shader supports.
